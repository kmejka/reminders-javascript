#REMINDERS in javascript

##Description

This app is a nodejs port of the [reminders](https://github.com/kmejka/reminders) application. It provides the same functionality as the original one:
* REST endpoints to handle reminders (create, read)
* a poller which polls Liberty Global schedule-api for schedule data about created reminders 

##Future enhancements 

* redis persistence
